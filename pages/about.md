# About Azolla

Our company is named after the <span class="bold">Azolla</span> Event:
50 million years ago atmospheric CO 2 levels were extremely high, and the future seemed bleak for all life forms. Then the Azolla Fern emerged and sucked the carbon dioxideÂ out of the air, restoring life and hope.

Today, San Francisco based <span class="bold">Azolla</span> is dedicated to making major contribution to end environmental degradation caused by toxic manufacturing. Our technology brings together genomics, industrial photosynthesis and advanced engineering to create a transformative material of the future.
