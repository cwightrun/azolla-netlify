  ### Inspired by Nature
  Nature uses CO2 and sunlight to grow things molecule by molecule, we borrowed this elegant formula to create EKKO.
:::

::: section
  ### Impactful
  Following nature’s original circular economy: reuse, recycle and biodegrade, without generating any waste, EKKO is the ultimate solution for circular manufacturing.
:::

::: section
  ### Customizable
  EKKO is genetically engineered to target specific attributes like strength, elasticity, conductivity, transparency and durability.

  It is stronger than Kevlar yet as light as cotton.
